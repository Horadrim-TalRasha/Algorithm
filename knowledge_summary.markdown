Smart Pointer

Network
==================


TCP shark hands
------------------
Reference: [TCP shark hands reference](http://www.cnblogs.com/zmlctt/p/3690998.html)


MTU and MSS

Computer Concepts
==================

Thread and Process
------------------
Process contains the time loading the context, cpu executing and saving the context.
Loading and saving context is heavy so the switch between processes takes time.
Thread shares the context and stack with their parent process so the switch between
threads does not take time.
